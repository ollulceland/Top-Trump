# Top-Trump #
## Project Brief 
This is the final project of _Code First: Girls x Coding Kickstarter - (Remote) Introduction to Python Programming_
Our original plan for the project was to create a small game where players compare stats, similar to the Top Trumps card game using the Pokemon API. 

After completion of the required tasks, we have also used the Star Wars API for extension.

### The basic flow of the game is: 
1. You are given a random card with different stats
2. You select one of the card's stats
3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
4. The stats of the two cards are compared
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins

### Our project has to fulfil the following requirements: 

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number
2. Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number
3. Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight (â˜…

4. Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent
5. Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
6. Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins
